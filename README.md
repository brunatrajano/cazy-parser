### Introduction
 *cazy-parser* is a tool that extract information from CAZy in a more usable and readable format. Firstly, a script reads the HTML structure and creates a mirror of the database as a tab delimited file. Secondly, information is extracted from the database according to user inputted parameters and presented to the user as a set of accession codes.

### Requirements

* Python 2.x
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) module

### Usage

*Both steps require an internet conection*

1) Database creation

`$ python create-cazy-db.py`

2) Extract sequences

`$ python select-cazy-sequences --db <database>`
* Options:

`--family` Family to be searched, case sensitive

`--subfamilies` Create a file for each subfamily

`--characterized` Create a file containing only characterized enzymes

### Examples

1) Extract all accession codes from family 9 of Glycosyl Transferases.

`$ python select-cazy-sequences --db CAZy_DB_xx-xx-xxxx.csv --family GT9`

This will generate the following files:
```
GT9.fasta
```

2) Extract all accession codes from family 43 of Glycoside Hydrolase, including subfamilies

`$ python select-cazy-sequences --db CAZy_DB_xx-xx-xxxx.csv --family GH43 --subfamilies`

This will generate the following files:

```
GH43.fasta
GH43_sub1.fasta
(...)
GH43_sub37.fasta
```

3) Extract all accession codes from family 42 of Polysaccharide Lyases including characterized entries

`$ python select-cazy-sequences --db CAZy_DB_xx-xx-xxxx.csv --family PL42 --characterized`

This will generate the following files:

```
PL42.fasta
PL42_characterized.fasta
```

### To-do

1. Extract sequences based on organism/domain
2. Select structural data

### Known bugs

**Sequence retrieval was done using the wrong NCBI service, thus blocking access to the site. Issue is being addressed.**
